# CHATBOT

`HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT`

The project is a Voice-Enabled Chatbot using AI, designed to provide an interactive and responsive voice assistant to users.  Users can communicate with the chatbot using natural language speech, and the  API converts their speech into text for processing.  The chatbot generates dynamic responses, tailoring its answers based on specific keywords or phrases. Additionally, the chatbot can perform tasks like opening specific URLs, granting users direct access to external resources.
